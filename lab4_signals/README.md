The circuit features:
- An AND gate (AND2) connecting ports 1 and 2, producing signal1
- A NOR gate (NOR2) connecting ports 3 and 4, producing signal2
- An XOR gate (XOR2) combining signal1 and signal2, producing signal3
- An OR gate (OR2) combining signal3 and port5, outputting to port6

## Project Description
This lab demonstrates the implementation and simulation of a more complex digital circuit using VHDL. It focuses on signal interconnection between different logic gates.

## Files Description
- `signal_rtl.vhd`: VHDL implementation of the circuit with multiple gates and signals
- `signal_tb.vhd`: Testbench file to verify the circuit functionality
- `lab4_signals.xise`: Xilinx ISE project file
- Various simulation and project files generated by Xilinx ISE

## How to Use
1. Open the project in Xilinx ISE by opening the `lab4_signals.xise` file
2. To run the simulation:
   - Right-click on the testbench file `signal_tb.vhd` in the design hierarchy
   - Select "Simulate Behavioral Model"

## Expected Results
The circuit should perform the following logical operations:
- signal1 = port1 AND port2
- signal2 = port3 NOR port4
- signal3 = signal1 XOR signal2
- port6 = signal3 OR port5

## Implementation Details
The circuit is implemented using VHDL with internal signals to connect the different gate components. This approach demonstrates how to use signals for interconnecting multiple components within a single architecture.

## Notes
This is part of a series of labs exploring digital logic circuits:
