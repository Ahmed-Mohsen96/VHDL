# NOT Gate Lab

This directory contains a VHDL implementation of a NOT gate digital circuit.

## Project Description
This lab demonstrates the implementation and simulation of a NOT logic gate using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) in Xilinx ISE.

## Files Description
- `not_rtl.vhd`: The VHDL implementation of the NOT gate circuit
- `not_tb.vhd`: Testbench file to verify the functionality of the NOT gate
- `lab3_notgate.xise`: Xilinx ISE project file
- Various simulation and project files generated by Xilinx ISE

## How to Use
1. Open the project in Xilinx ISE by opening the `lab3_notgate.xise` file
2. To run the simulation:
   - Right-click on the testbench file `not_tb.vhd` in the design hierarchy
   - Select "Simulate Behavioral Model"

## Expected Results
The NOT gate should invert the input signal, producing:
- Output = '0' when Input = '1'
- Output = '1' when Input = '0'

## Implementation Details
The NOT gate is implemented using basic VHDL constructs. The entity has one input port and one output port. The architecture defines the logical operation that inverts the input signal.

## Notes
This is part of a series of labs exploring basic digital logic gates:
- Lab 1: AND Gate
- Lab 2: OR Gate
- Lab 3: NOT Gate (Current)
