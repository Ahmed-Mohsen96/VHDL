The circuit diagram shows a more complex logic circuit with the following components:
- Input ports: P1 through P7
- Output ports: Out1 through Out4
- Gates: AND2, NAND2, NOR2, OR3, XOR gates
- Signals: s1, s2, s3, s4, s5

The connections are:
1. P1 and P2 connect to an AND2 gate to produce s1
2. P3 and P4 connect to another AND2 gate to produce s2
3. s1 and s2 connect to a NAND2 gate to produce s3
4. s3 and a connection feed into a NOR2 gate to produce s4 (which connects to Out1)
5. s4, s3, s2, and other input ports feed into complex logic to produce s5
6. s5 connects to Out2
7. Multiple input ports and signals feed into an XOR gate for Out3
8. P7 connects directly to Out4
