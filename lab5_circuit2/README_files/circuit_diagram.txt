The circuit diagram shows a logic circuit with the following components:
- Input ports: port1, port2, port3
- Output port: port4
- Gates: AND2, OR2, XOR2
- Signals: s1, s2, s3

The connections are:
1. port1 and port2 are inputs to AND2 gate, producing signal s1
2. port3 and a feedback from the circuit are inputs to another OR2 gate, producing signal s2
3. s1 and s2 are inputs to the OR2 gate, producing signal s3
4. s3 and a feedback connection are inputs to XOR2 gate, which outputs to port4
