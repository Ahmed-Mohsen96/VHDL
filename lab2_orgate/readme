# VHDL OR Gate Implementation

This repository contains a simple VHDL implementation of a 2-input OR gate along with its testbench.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic OR logic gate in VHDL. The OR gate takes two single-bit inputs and produces a single-bit output that is high when at least one of the inputs is high.

## Files Description

- **or_trl.vhd**: Main implementation of the OR logic gate
- **or_tb.vhd**: Testbench to verify the functionality of the OR gate

## Implementation Details

The OR gate is implemented using a simple behavioral architecture:

```vhdl
port3 <= port1 or port2;
```

Where:
- `port1` and `port2` are the input ports
- `port3` is the output port

## Testbench

The testbench verifies the behavior of the OR gate by applying different combinations of inputs:

1. Both inputs start at '0'
2. `port1` toggles between '0' and '1' every 50 ns
3. `port2` toggles between '0' and '1' every 100 ns

This creates all possible input combinations:
- (0,0) → output should be 0
- (1,0) → output should be 1
- (0,1) → output should be 1
- (1,1) → output should be 1

## Development Environment

This project was developed using Xilinx ISE Design Suite.

## Usage

To use this project:
1. Open the project in a VHDL-compatible development environment
2. Compile the design files
3. Run the simulation with the testbench
4. View the waveform output to verify correct functioning

## Truth Table

| port1 | port2 | port3 (output) |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 0     | 0     | 0              |
| 0     | 1     | 1              |
| 1     | 0     | 1              |
| 1     | 1     | 1              |

## Circuit Diagram

A simple OR gate with two inputs:

```
port1 ----\
           OR ---- port3
port2 ----/
```

## Expected Waveform Behavior

During simulation, you should observe:
- When both inputs are 0, the output is 0
- When either or both inputs are 1, the output is 1
- The output changes state without delay (ideal behavior)
